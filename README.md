**`Digital Craftsman (Developer/Creator/Influencer)`**

I'm an Python developer and content creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. 
All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All video content is built the same way,
from ideation and planning, all the way to finalizing the content with artistic touches. I publish that content on my YouTube & Instagram channel "max0rado"
